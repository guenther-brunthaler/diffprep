This project is about a preprocessor/postprocessor for "diff" and
"patch", allowing to create word-, character-, byte- or bit-based
diffs and patches.

It requires an ANSI-C 89 capable C compiler and a standard "make"
utility.

Run

$ make

to compile and build the program. If you want to build with
specific compiler flags, you can invoke 'make' like this instead:

$ make CFLAGS="-D NDEBUG -O3 -s"

Then run

$ ./diffprep -h

for displaying help, copyright and usage information.
