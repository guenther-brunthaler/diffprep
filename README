This project is about a preprocessor/postprocessor for "diff" and
"patch", allowing to create word-, character-, byte- or bit-based
diffs and patches.

It can also be "mis-used" as a hex-dump or bit-dump utility,
supporting the conversion of manually edited dump files back to
the original binary data (similar to "xxd -r").

The utility has no external library dependencies and only uses
the standard C runtime library.

It requires an ANSI-C 89 capable C compiler and a standard
POSIX-compliant "make" utility for building.

Run

$ make

to compile and build the program. If you want to build with
specific compiler flags, you can invoke 'make' like this instead:

$ make CFLAGS="-D NDEBUG -O2 -s"

Then run

$ ./diffprep -h
